####Stage 1
**In this stage youâ€™ll build the core experience of your movies app.**

Your app will:

*Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.

*Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
 *The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated

*Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
 *original title
 *movie poster image thumbnail
 *A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
 *user rating (called vote_average in the api)
 *release date
